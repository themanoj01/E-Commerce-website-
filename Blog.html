         for bonsai enthusiasts to access information about bonsai plants and purchase them online. This has allowed for a wider
          reach for bonsai sellers, as they can now sell their plants to a global market. On the other hand, technology has 
          also made it easier for counterfeit bonsai plants to be sold. Online platforms can be used to sell fake bonsai plants

           dissatisfaction with their purchase. It's important for bonsai sellers to adapt to technology and find ways to use
